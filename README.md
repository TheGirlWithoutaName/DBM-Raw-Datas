Hey there! Welcome to my repository!

This is just a huge dumb of some commands I've made in DBM/Discord Bot Maker that I'm willing to share for those who need them.
I know a lot of people (myself included) always ask others to do raw datas for them because they don't know how to do it, so I'm hoping my commands be of use to some people.
Some commands might be modifications of preexisting commands so watch out for that.

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Enjoy my raw datas.
