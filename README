Hey, hey! Welcome to this repository! I don't expect anyone to read this, but if you read all of this, +1 respects.


All of these raw datas in this repository are free to use. Some will be made completely by myself, others will be a heavy modification of another raw data I found (in which credit will always be mentioned in the comment of the raw data). All raw datas will always be provided in raw data format and not compressed data. All I ask is that you credit me in some form if you use any of my raw datas REEE

They'll most likely be completely random commands I came up with while trying to code for my bigger bots, and I know a lot of people (myself including) on the DBM Network Discord server are always asking for new raw datas, especially those that didn't get carried over from the DBM Archives Discord server due to that dbm.xyz site veing broked forever. More raw datas will be added as I am able to get myself more familiar with the program, as well as when new mods come out. Some commands might be inspired by archived commands or attempts at revivals of some lost archived commands due to above said site deletion.

Any issues with my raw datas can be forwarded to The Girl Without a Name#3967 on Discord.
Enjoy!
